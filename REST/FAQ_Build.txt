deployment on www.fincurve.com (THERE IS NO VC++ 2010 Runtime Redistributable):

- build server part in VC9 / x86 / Release, deploy along with web.config on www.fincurve.com
- build client (SL) part in VC10 / AnyCPU / Release, when adding service reference, use http://www.fincurve.com/YieldCurveSrv.svc
- when adding SL page to BlogEngine use www.fincurve.com as URL in HTML editor <form> part related to SL

- add the following into Global.apsx of BlogEngine (initialization method at the end) 

FinancialLayer.QuantLibAdaptor.Init();

4004 error on silverlight on startup - rebuild SL project (remove/add service reference and rebuild)

deploymnet (local) of BlogEngine:

- to resolve permission issue on App_Data open properties of App_Data and add write access to IIS_IUSRS on this folder 

- silverlight controll shows no data - using Fiddler Web Debugger have found that .png mentioned in .xaml is missing (VS debuggin was fine)

Parser Error Message: Could not create type

	on 64 bit change yieldcurveweb proj to MixedCpu (in the top of VS toolbar)

silverlight add service reference object not set instance

	open solution file in notepad and remove dependency from wcf (if changed to aspx)

to hit breakpoint in SL

	set IE as default browser

on x64 machines:

	for IIS deployment build as AnyCPU (make sure that managed c++ should be built in x64 mode, or force app-pool to x32)

Configuring apache server:

apache + mod_mono.so (copied from installation of mono under win)
php

	/test moved from mono install to HOME, test in original location left empty, cant' remove due to access violation error
	/htdocs moved from apache install to HOME with link left in original place
	http.conf changed to reflect those changes

FileNotFound Exceptin on deployment - build as Release .. and if built as x86 then bind to the application pool with .net 4.0 and 32bit allowed + install VC++10 Redistributable package (x86, x64)

Object reference not set to instance of an object when adding service reference to SL: open solution file (.sln) in notepad, locate SL-project and remove

Debuggin on IIS: - in IIS manager open ASP icon and allow debugging features (set all to true) .. select application pool, click on "advanced settings"
and change identity to network service

!!!!!!!!
IF doesn't work on remote hosting - try to mess with web.config and client.config, use wcfTestClient.exe from VC10 command prompt to test 
wcf services and to check client.config .. also remove all 'crap' from web.config which is not in <system.serviceModel> and <connectionString>
!!!!!!!!

blogEngine test login admin/admin

// JavaScript

to debug JS in VS make IE the default browser + enable script debugging in IE settings
